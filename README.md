# ShapelyM, linear referencing in 3D

The term linear referencing emerged from engineering applications where it was preferable to locate a point along a linear feature (often roads) by referencing that location to some other well-defined location, rather than using classical geographic coordinate systems. The most familiar illustration of linear referencing is the mile markers along U.S. highways (Federal Highway Administration 2001, Federal Transit Administration 2003).

Shapely is a BSD-licensed Python package for manipulation and analysis of planar geometric objects. It is based on the widely deployed GEOS (the engine of PostGIS) and JTS (from which GEOS is ported) libraries. It can be useful to specify position along linear features such as LineStrings and MultiLineStrings with a **1-dimensional** referencing system. Shapely supports linear referencing based on length or distance, evaluating the distance along a geometric object to the projection of a given point, or the point at a given distance along the object.

ShapelyM can be used to linear referencing in 3D and is designed to work (without) shapely.

## Installation

```bash
pip install shapelyM
```


## Way of working
1. project (3d) point on on 2d polyline (representation of a 3d polyline)
2. get height on polyline
3. get measure
4. get side of line (by azimuth)

## Usage:

```python
from shapely.geometry import Point
from shapelyM import MeasureLineString, MeasurePoint
```

```python
line_measure = MeasureLineString([[3, 0, 0], [3, 10, 0], [3, 20, 0], [3, 30, 0]])
projection = line_measure.project(Point(0, 5, 0))
# or:
# projection = line_measure.project(MeasurePoint(0, 5, 0))
```

### Returns:
shapelyM.LineProjection

```
{
    'point': MeasurePoint, 
    'point_on_line': MeasurePoint, 
    'distance_to_line': 5.830951894845301, 
    'distance_to_line_2d': 3.0, 
    'distance_along_line': 7.0710678118654755, 
    'side_of_line': LeftRightOnLineEnum
}
 ```

#### MeasurePoint:

```
{
    'x': 3.0,
    'y': 5.0,
    'z': 5.0,
    'm': 7.0710678118654755,
    'shapely': shapely.geometry.point.Point
}
```


#### LeftRightOnLineEnum:
```
    left = "Left"
    right = "Right"
    on_vector = "On"
```

Feel free to do some black math magic, add test or make suggestions.

## Roadmap:
- [X] make prototype work
- [X] bumpversion including release type
- [X] pipeline | make : black
- [X] pipeline | make : type checking
- [X] pipeline | deploy on pypi by GH A
- [X] version 0.1.0-alpha
- [X] implement "point on side of line"
- [X] refactor
- [ ] version 0.1.0-beta
- [ ] implement MeasureLineString from shapely Linestring
- [ ] return profile line on from measure as shapely
- [ ] return profile line on from and to measures as shapely
- [ ] refactor
- [ ] version 0.2.0-alpha 
- [ ] make it work without shapely but easy to use with shapely
- [ ] 100% test coverage
- [ ] version 1.0.0

## Requirements 
pyproject.toml to manage requirements and can be build by a newer build backend.

## Build and Test
Install MakeFile for quality of life

After setting up a venv we use `make install` to build a fresh pulled repo

Code quality checks and testing needs to be passed and will be checked on every commit and in the pipeline. If code wont pass it wont commit so make sure to check it before with make check-all!

We use:
- flit as a build-backend. 
- pytest for testing, manual by `make test` in a console.
- flake8 and black for linting, manual by `make lint` in a console.
- myPy for typechecking, manual by `make typecheck` in a console.
- black and isort, manual by `make format` in a console.
- bumpversion for changing the version
- pyAutocad for debug visualizing


## Testing
Make an effort to test each bit of functionality you add. Try to keep it simple.
